    <!-- Project Overview -->
    <section class="project-overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this project for the Computational Fluid Dynamics course (24-718) at CMU, my team and I developed a Python-based 
            script to solve the Navier-Stokes equations and model the behavior of inert gas flow within an additive manufacturing 
            chamber. Our work focuses on optimizing the gas flow to efficiently remove spatter particles and manage heat transfer, 
            ensuring a stable environment for additive manufacturing processes.

    <section class="project-goals">
        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Accurately simulate gas flow behavior to minimize turbulence and optimize chamber efficiency.</li>
            <li>Ensure effective heat transfer around the build plate to prevent residual stresses during manufacturing.</li>
            <li>Reduce spatter accumulation by optimizing the inert gas flow to carry particles away from the build area.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="Methods">
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>
            We quantitatively classified gas flow configurations to identify the most effective setup. Any configuration where the average gas speed over a 0.1 m space above the build plate was below 2 m/s was considered inadequate for clearing spatter. Our analysis revealed that placing the inlet near the bottom (0.0 - 0.1 m) and the outlet near the top (0.3 - 0.4 m) provided the best results. This setup achieved an average gas speed of 2.5 m/s, ensuring spatter removal while minimizing temperature loss. With only a 5% reduction in the thermal profile and 90% of the build plate maintaining optimal temperature, this configuration offered the best balance of flow and heat retention.

    <!-- Results and Findings -->
    <section class="results">
        <h2>Results and Findings</h2>
        <p>
            Our simulations revealed key insights into the flow dynamics within the chamber. We observed that altering gas 
            viscosity and flow direction could significantly impact spatter removal and temperature stability:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flow optimization: Altered gas viscosity and flow direction reduced spatter accumulation by approximately 30%.</li>
            <li>Heat management: Adjustments in flow rate and nozzle placement improved temperature consistency across the build plate.</li>
            <li>Chamber efficiency: Modified inert gas flow reduced eddy formations, promoting smoother gas distribution.</li>
        </ul>
