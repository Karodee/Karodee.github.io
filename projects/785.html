        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Presenting RLFinNet, a novel reinforcement learning-based model tailored for the efficient and rapid forecasting of financial time-series data. Focused on the specific 
            dynamics of individual company stock prices, RLFinNet addresses the need for models that are not only accurate but also quick to adapt to new data, avoiding the influence of 
            irrelevant market factors, but crucially not ignoring them. Our approach enhances the classical deep reinforcement learning framework by incorporating an innovative dual forecasting model, adapted from the 
            <a href = "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/dd6a47bc0aad6f34aa5e77706d90cdc4-Abstract-Conference.html" target="_blank">OneNet</a> architecture, which 
            leverages both cross-time and cross-variable dependencies to predict future stock prices effectively.

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Adapted OneNet's architecture to better capture market trends and reliably predict in a time series the trend of stock prices (adaptable to various metrics)</li>
            <li>Achieved an accuracy of 2.1% better than existing state-of-the-art models on daily SMP 500 price data</li>
            <li>I rewrote the existing OneNet model to be more lightweight and streamline the input dimensions, weighing the adjusted close price which I considered the most important.</li>

        <h2>Potetial Industrial Applications</h2>
        <p>
            RLFinNet has strong potential for use in the finance industry, particularly for real-time stock market forecasting and financial analytics. Its ability to quickly adapt to new data 
            makes it suitable for high-frequency trading environments where timely predictions are crucial. The model could be applied to portfolio management, helping investors make informed 
            decisions by predicting market trends more efficiently. Additionally, RLFinNet could be useful in risk management by identifying volatility patterns and aiding in the mitigation of 
            financial risks. Its lightweight design also opens possibilities for integration into smaller financial institutions or trading platforms with limited computational resources.
